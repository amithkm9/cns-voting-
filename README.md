Project Title:
Secure Voting System Using Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)

Problem Statement:
In an increasingly digital world, the demand for secure and trustworthy electronic voting systems is rising. However, many existing systems are vulnerable to tampering, voter impersonation, and privacy breaches. The integrity of democratic processes hinges on ensuring that each vote is confidential, verifiable, and cast only once by an authenticated voter.
This project proposes a Secure Voting System that leverages Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) to provide strong cryptographic security while maintaining low computational overhead. The system ensures that votes are encrypted for confidentiality, digitally signed for integrity and authenticity, and securely transmitted and stored for transparent and auditable elections.

Objectives:
* To implement public key encryption using ECC for secure vote transmission.
* To use digital signatures for vote authenticity and integrity verification.
* To ensure anonymity of the voter's identity while preserving vote traceability for auditing.
* To prevent duplicate voting and replay attacks through authentication and timestamping.
* To simulate a full-fledged client-server-based voting system for demonstration.

Scope:
* Voter Registration System with ECC key pair generation.
* Vote Casting Module where the voter encrypts the vote using the election authority’s public key and signs it with their private key.
* Vote Receiver/Counting Authority that decrypts the vote using its private key and verifies the signature using the voter’s public key.
* Secure and encrypted data transmission channel with logging.
* Basic UI for voter login, vote selection, and result display.

Expected Functionalities:
* Voter authentication using unique IDs and ECC public key.
* Vote encryption using ECC and AES (hybrid cryptography for performance).
* Digital signature verification.
* Prevention of multiple votes from the same user.
* Real-time vote counting and result display with verified ballots.

Technology Stack:
* Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (or simple Tkinter GUI if desktop-based)
* Backend: Python (Flask/FastAPI)
* Database: SQLite, PostgreSQL, or Firebase
* Cryptographic Libraries: cryptography, ecdsa, PyCryptodome

Security Features:
* ECC-based key exchange and encryption
* Digital signatures for vote verification
* Timestamping & Nonce to prevent replay attacks
* Secure session management and user authentication

Deliverables:
* Complete source code with modular structure
* Documentation detailing system architecture, ECC workflow, and cryptographic methods
* Working demo (video or live) of the voting process
* Report with results, challenges faced, and future enhancements
